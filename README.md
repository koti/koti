My name is Menelaos Kotoglou and I'm currently studying Computer Engineering and Informatics at Cyprus University of Technology.</br>

I prefer programming in Python and currently learning Golang, but I'm constantly trying to find and explore new languages, frameworks, and libraries.</br>

Machine Learning and Software Development are my main passions.
